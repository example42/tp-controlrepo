# This is a simple example of how to use the dir_hash type to manage
# the content of a user home directory. The target path is the user's
# home directory (CHANGE IT!) and the source is from the mydata module
# under the site directory. All the files present under site/mydata/files/home
# a recursively copied to the specified path.
# CHANGE these files according to your needs

tp::dir_hash:
  /home/al/:
    source: 'puppet:///modules/mydata/home'
